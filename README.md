WIP.

## Wishlist

Obviously there's existing code cleanliness stuff to take care of. I'd like to make a channel on which torrent updates get pushed regularly; that just seems cleaner than configuring the timer in `main`.

+ Show UI before fetching torrent metadata.
+ List files in the torrent in a prettier format.
+ Nagging terminal input consumption problem.
+ Easy build to a universally usable command. godo?

## To-do

+ Gif demo
+ Lots of cleanup
