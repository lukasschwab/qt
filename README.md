WIP.

## Wishlist

Obviously there's existing code cleanliness stuff to take care of. I'd like to make a channel on which torrent updates get pushed regularly; that just seems cleaner than configuring the timer in `main`.

Also, there are some minor reliability issues––hanging before showing the UI! that I want to take care of.

+ Show UI before fetching torrent metadata.
+ List files in the torrent in a prettier format.
